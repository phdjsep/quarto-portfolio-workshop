### But what is it really?

It's an EXTREMELY powerful software that allows you to inline your code and prose to create
a large array of different outputs like HTML, PDF, websites, books, etc.

*You'll see what we're talking about* ðŸ˜‰

## Tool Setup and Walkthrough

### For today...

- **You must have a Github account. Please create one if you don't.**
- We'll use Github Codespaces with VS Code

### For future reference...

If you were to explore doing this on your own, you'd need the following at least:

- IDE (ex, VS Code, RStudio Desktop, Positron, etc)
- Python, R, and/or Julia
- Quarto
- Cloud Version Control is highly recommended (eg, Github, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc)
- You could also just continue to use your codespace...
